# Opencore microsoft-surface-7-pro-hackintosh-monterey

Functional efi for microsoft surface 7 pro laptop, working with monterey 12.6.7

## Specs
* Intel Core i5-1035G4
* 8 GB LPDDR4x RAM
* Intel® Iris™ Plus


Efi created only for this model, I do not recommend the use in other models.



If you are thinking of making a hackintosh with this model you can take the efi and try it, but I am not responsible for any type of use that is going to be given to it.
